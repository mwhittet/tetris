# Tetris
Creating a basic Tetris game in JavaScript, tutorial provided by Meth Meth Method (https://youtu.be/H2aW5V46khA)

- Rotating a matrix
- Rudimentary requestAnimationFrame listening
- Handling keyboard input

Since this uses ES6, it might not run on all browsers just yet. I completed the tutorial using Chrome Version 54.

I'm thinking of adding:

- Music
- On click start
- Preview of next piece etc.
